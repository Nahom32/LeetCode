<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/bulb-switcher/">319. Bulb Switcher</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><div><p>There are <code>n</code> bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs, then&nbsp;you turn off every second bulb.</p>

<p>On the third round, you toggle every third bulb (turning on if it's off or turning off if it's on). For the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> round, you toggle every <code>i</code> bulb. For the <code>n<sup>th</sup></code> round, you only toggle the last bulb.</p>

<p>Return <em>the number of bulbs that are on after <code>n</code> rounds</em>.</p>

Explanation: At first, the three bulbs are [off, off, off].
After the first round, the three bulbs are [on, on, on].
After the second round, the three bulbs are [on, off, on].
After the third round, the three bulbs are [on, off, off]. 
So you should return 1 because there is only one bulb is on." data-snippet-id="ext.5e0b04be2b0b7e42a4b433b29796e456" data-snippet-saved="false" data-codota-status="done"><strong>Input:</strong> n = 3
